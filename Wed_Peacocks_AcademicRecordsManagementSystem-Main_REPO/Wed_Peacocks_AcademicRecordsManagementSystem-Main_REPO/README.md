# PHASE 7 
The **Academic Records Management System (ARMS)** is a database solution designed to manage academic data efficiently and securely. It incorporates advanced database programming techniques like triggers, cursors, functions, packages, and auditing mechanisms to automate workflows, enforce institutional rules, and ensure data security.

## Features

1. **Triggers**: Enforce business rules and automate tasks.
2. **Cursors**: Process data row-by-row for detailed operations.
3. **Functions**: Encapsulate logic for modular, reusable calculations.
4. **Packages**: Organize related database operations for maintainability.
5. **Auditing**: Track database changes for accountability.
   
    ### Triggers
   **Purpose:** Automate data validation and enforce business rules.

#### Example: Validate Enrollment Status

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER check_enrollment_status
BEFORE INSERT ON Students
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF :NEW.enrollment_status NOT IN ('Active', 'Inactive', 'Graduated') THEN
        RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Invalid enrollment status!');
    END IF;
END;
/
```
### CursorS

**Purpose:** Process data row-by-row for detailed operations.

#### Example: Generate Student Enrollment Report

```sql
DECLARE
    CURSOR student_cursor IS
        SELECT student_id, name 
        FROM Students s
        JOIN Enrollments e 
        ON s.student_id = e.student_id
        WHERE e.term = 'Fall 2022';
    student_record student_cursor%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
    OPEN student_cursor;
    LOOP
        FETCH student_cursor INTO student_record;
        EXIT WHEN student_cursor%NOTFOUND;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Student: ' || student_record.name || ' (ID: ' || student_record.student_id || ')');
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE student_cursor;
END;
/
```
### Packages

**Purpose:** Group related procedures and functions for modularity and maintainability.

#### Example: Package Specification

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE academic_utils IS
    PROCEDURE log_student_activity(student_id_in INT);
    FUNCTION calculate_gpa(student_id_in INT) RETURN NUMBER;
END academic_utils;
/
```
### Functions

**Purpose:** Provide modular, reusable logic for tasks that require specific calculations or operations.

#### Example: Function to Calculate Average Grade for a Course

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_average_grade (course_id_in INT)
RETURN NUMBER IS
    avg_grade NUMBER;
BEGIN
    SELECT AVG(CASE grade 
               WHEN 'A' THEN 4 
               WHEN 'B' THEN 3 
               WHEN 'C' THEN 2 
               WHEN 'D' THEN 1 
               ELSE 0 END)
    INTO avg_grade
    FROM Grades
    WHERE course_id = course_id_in;
    RETURN avg_grade;
END;
/
```
### Auditing

**Purpose:** Track and restrict changes to sensitive data for accountability.

#### Example: Audit Student Table Changes

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER audit_students_changes
AFTER UPDATE OR DELETE ON Students
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO AuditLog (action, student_id, change_date)
    VALUES (CASE 
               WHEN DELETING THEN 'DELETE'
               ELSE 'UPDATE' 
            END, :OLD.student_id, SYSDATE);
END;
/
```

### Scope and Limitations
Scope:

Triggers enforce business rules and maintain consistency.
Cursors process complex operations row by row.
Functions and packages improve reusability and modularity.
Auditing enhances security by tracking changes.

## Limitations:

Triggers can introduce performance overhead during bulk operations.
Cursors are less efficient compared to set-based operations.
Complex auditing may require additional storage and processing.

### Problem Statement and Rationale
The Academic Records Management System (ARMS) handles sensitive student data, requiring advanced database programming techniques to ensure accurate, secure, and efficient operations. To meet these requirements:

Triggers: Enforce business rules, such as ensuring valid enrollment statuses and data consistency.
Cursors: Allow row-by-row operations, such as processing audit logs for database changes.
Functions: Encapsulate logic for tasks like GPA calculation, enhancing code modularity.
Packages: Organize related procedures and functions for better maintainability and reusability.
Auditing: Track and restrict changes to sensitive data, ensuring transparency and accountability.

### Implementation Details
a) Triggers
Purpose: Automatically enforce business rules and maintain data integrity when specific database actions occur.
Use Cases:
Validating enrollment status during data insertion or updates.
Ensuring grades entered are within a valid range.
Logging actions in the audit table after data changes.
b) Cursors
Purpose: Handle row-by-row processing for tasks requiring detailed attention to individual database records.
Use Cases:
Iterating through grade records to generate audit entries.
Processing student course enrollments for custom reporting.
c) Functions
Purpose: Provide modular, reusable logic for tasks that require specific calculations or operations.
Use Cases:
Calculating a student’s GPA based on grades and credit hours.
Determining the number of credit hours a student has completed.
d) Packages
Purpose: Group related procedures, functions, and variables into a single unit for better code organization and security.
Use Cases:
Managing student-related operations such as adding a student or retrieving their status.
Creating a central package for all auditing operations to ensure consistency.
e) Auditing
Purpose: Monitor and log database activities, ensuring accountability and compliance with security standards.
Use Cases:
Tracking changes to sensitive fields like grades or enrollment status.
Logging user actions for later review and accountability.
Restricting data access based on user roles.

### Demonstration
1. Triggers in Action
Demonstrate how inserting or updating a student with invalid enrollment status is prevented.
Show triggers that log changes to grades or student details into the audit table.
2. Row-by-Row Cursor Processing
Illustrate how cursors are used to process audit entries for each grade change, generating detailed logs.
3. Modular Functions
Demonstrate a function that calculates GPA for a selected student, showcasing accuracy and modularity.
4. Package Usage
Highlight the use of packages to streamline operations, such as adding new students or managing course enrollments.
5. Audit Logs
Show audit logs capturing actions like grade changes or sensitive data updates.
Demonstrate how role-based restrictions ensure only authorized users can modify specific records.
